# Challenge: QML

Tasks and guides that should help you learn [QML](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html)

## Tasks

The assignment is to solve a number of tasks targeted at sharpening your QML skills. All tasks are solvable even if you are not an experienced frontend developer as the point of tasks itself is to make you learn QML.

Take your time. We put more focus on quality of code over speed of coding, since in time, quality of code will directly regulate speed of coding.

There are few things to remember:

* Communication - if you have an issue, ask.
* Team - you work with other people, everything you write will at some time be read and need to be changed by someone else.
* Code - code must be clean, unneeded space and old code in comments should never be upstream.
* Comments - your code is not self documenting but it doesn't need a comment of every line, describe complex blocks and modules so even a newcomer can understand what was the idea.

### List of Tasks

1. Movie Browser
    * [Subtask 1](movie-browser/subtask-1/Readme.md), introduction to QML.
    * [Subtask 2](movie-browser/subtask-2/Readme.md), dynamic content.
    * [Subtask 3](movie-browser/subtask-3/Readme.md), REST API.
2. Simple TV
    * [Subtask 1](simple-tv/subtask-1/Readme.md), content playout.
    * [Subtask 2](simple-tv/subtask-2/Readme.md), responsiveness.

### Prerequisites & Environment

-

### Solutions

* Solutions for each task should be placed in a standalone repository.
    * Each subtask should be placed in it's own directory.
* Solutions should work on desktop (Linux, Mac, Windows) and Android devices.

### Further Improvements & Tasks

* Use `git rebase` instead of `git pull/merge`.
* Find grammatical errors and send a pull request with fixes.
* Add `.gitignore` to exclude files that should not be upstream.
* Send pull requests to improve what you think could be better.
* Write a new task that you think would be useful for people when learning QML.
